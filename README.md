# circom-plus

Like [GoPlus](https://github.com/goplus/gop) vs Go, we build circom-plus as a DSL based on circom to impove circuit developer productivity.

# Goal

1. Less boilerplate.

# Current Status

We are in early stage. Codes here are very unstable.

We are using much `magic` here like regex replace rather than lexicon/parse now.
